# Enhanced Feature-Based Approach for Hate Speech and Offensive Language Detection through NLP Techniques

#### Overview:

The project focuses on the challenging task of automatically detecting hate speech on social media, specifically distinguishing hate speech from other instances of offensive language. The significance of this project within Natural Language Processing (NLP) lies in ​the need to​ accurately differentiate between hate speech and offensive language, as hate speech can have serious legal and moral implications. This study utilizes a publicly available dataset provided by CrowdFlower containing hate speech keywords, which are then labeled into three categories: hate speech, offensive ​language, and neither​. By training ​a multi-class classifier to distinguish between these​ ​categories, the​ project aims ​to improve the accuracy of hate speech detection on​ social media. The results highlight the challenges and nuances involved in accurately classifying hate speech, emphasizing the importance of ​context and the​ heterogeneity of hate speech usage. ​This project contributes to the ongoing efforts​ in NLP to address the detection and ​classification of hate speech​, providing insights into the complexities of identifying and differentiating between hate speech and offensive language in online communication. 

#### Objectives and methodology:

The project proposal aims to address ​the challenge of distinguishing hate speech from​ ​offensive language on social media. The​ methodology involves using ​a crowd-sourced​ hate speech lexicon dataset, which is then labeled into three categories: hate speech, offensive language, or neither. ​Machine learning models are trained to​ differentiate between these categories using various features extracted from the tweets. The study highlights the challenges in accurately classifying hate speech and offensive language, emphasizing the importance of context and linguistic nuances in detection. 

Overall, this project contributes to the field of NLP by offering a valuable resource for detecting toxic language online and addressing ​the problem of hate speech in social​ media. It underscores the significance of utilizing NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to tackle issues related to harmful content dissemination on digital platforms.
